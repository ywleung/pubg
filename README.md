This project contains IPyhton Notebook files for a Kaggle competition <a ref='https://www.kaggle.com/c/pubg-finish-placement-prediction#description'>PUBG Finish Placement Prediction (Kernels Only)</a>. The MAE should be around 0.02335, top 27% of the leaderboard.

EDA.ipynb performs Exploratory Data Analysis and a preliminary model on the train set. neural_network.ipynb and lightGB.ipynb perform feature engineering and modeling.

Conclusion:
group statistics are the most important features to the prediction
neural network is unstable in this dataset
